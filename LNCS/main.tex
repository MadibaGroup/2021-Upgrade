%\paragraph{Leverage.} Alice and Bob each have \$100. Alice buys 1 share of APPL, while Bob who buys 1 share of APPL and takes a \$900 loan to buy another 9 shares (assume the loan is free). APPL increases from \$100 to \$200. Alice is now worth \$200 and Bob is worth \$2000. Next, assume APPL decreases in value to \$90. Alice is worth \$90 but Bob is worth \$0 (his shares are worth \$900 which is the same as the loan). If APPL goes to \$85, Bob is insolvent. Alice and Bob both profit when APPL increases in value and both lose money when it decreases, but Bob's gains/losses are amplified by a 10:1 ratio. This is called leverage. Many exchanges (in both traditional and crypto-markets) offer credit for leveraged trading. It is also known as margin trading---the exchange does not want Bob to become insolvent and owe it money that he might never pay, so the exchange forces Bob to deposit a certain amount of money (called margin) with the exchange to cover any loses. If margin account approaches zero and Bob is unable, unwilling, or does not have enough time to top it up, the exchange will close all of his financial positions and repay the loan.
